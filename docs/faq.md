# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about AgentAnycast -- architecture, networking, and day-to-day usage.

## Start Here

### I just installed agentanycast. What do I do next?

Run the built-in demo:

```bash
agentanycast demo
```

Then open another terminal and send it a message (paste the Peer ID from the demo output):

```bash
agentanycast send <PEER_ID> "Hello!"
```

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for the full walkthrough.

### Which SDK should I use -- Python or TypeScript?

Both share the same daemon, protocol, and network. Choose based on your stack:
- **Python** -- more framework adapters (CrewAI, LangGraph, Google ADK, OpenAI Agents, Claude Agent SDK, AWS Strands)
- **TypeScript** -- native Node.js integration

### Can I use this with my existing agent framework?

Yes. The Python SDK has adapters for CrewAI, LangGraph, Google ADK, OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK, and AWS Strands. Each requires one function call to turn your existing agent into a P2P agent. See [examples](../examples/).

## General

### Do I need a relay server for local development?

No. On a local network, agents discover each other automatically via mDNS — no relay, no configuration. A relay is only needed when agents are on different networks (e.g., across the internet or behind separate NATs).

### Can Python and TypeScript agents communicate?

Yes. Both SDKs communicate with the same Go daemon over gRPC and use the same A2A wire protocol. A Python agent and a TypeScript agent on the same machine (or across the network) can exchange tasks seamlessly.

### Is traffic encrypted through relay servers?

Yes. All agent-to-agent communication is end-to-end encrypted using the Noise_XX protocol. Relay servers forward only ciphertext — they cannot read, modify, or inspect the contents of any message. There is no plaintext transport path in the codebase.

### How do I run multiple agents on one machine?

Use the `home` parameter to give each agent its own daemon instance and data directory:

```python
async with Node(card=card_a, home="/tmp/agent-a") as agent_a:
    async with Node(card=card_b, home="/tmp/agent-b") as agent_b:
        ...
```

Each `home` directory gets its own Unix socket, key pair, and daemon process.

### What happens if the daemon crashes?

The SDK automatically restarts the daemon on the next operation (e.g., `send_task`, `serve_forever`). The daemon's state (keys, peer store) is persisted in BoltDB, so nothing is lost across restarts.

### Can I connect to agents behind different NATs?

Yes. The daemon first attempts direct hole-punching using the DCUtR protocol. If that fails (e.g., due to symmetric NAT), it automatically falls back to routing through a relay server. From your application's perspective, the connection just works — no code changes needed.

# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them.

## "Connection refused" on daemon socket

The daemon is not running or the socket path is wrong.

- Verify the daemon is running: `ps aux | grep agentanycastd`
- Check the default socket path: `~/.agentanycast/daemon.sock`
- If using a custom `home`, ensure the path matches: `<home>/daemon.sock`
- The SDK normally starts the daemon automatically. If it fails, check stderr output for download or permission errors.

## "Peer not found"

The target peer is unreachable.

- Confirm the peer is online and its agent is running.
- Double-check the Peer ID string — a single wrong character will cause this error.
- If the peer is on a different network, ensure both agents are configured with the same relay address.
- Try `agentanycast discover <skill>` to verify the peer is registered in the skill registry.

## "Daemon binary not found"

The daemon binary was not downloaded or is not on the expected path.

- The SDK auto-downloads the daemon on first use. Check your internet connection.
- Set `AGENTANYCAST_DAEMON_PATH` to point to a manually downloaded binary.
- On CI environments, pre-download the binary and set the environment variable to avoid network calls during tests.

## "Permission denied on socket"

File permissions prevent access to the Unix domain socket.

- Check ownership and permissions: `ls -la ~/.agentanycast/daemon.sock`
- The socket is created by the daemon process. If you ran the daemon as root and are now running as a regular user (or vice versa), permissions will mismatch.
- Delete the stale socket file and restart: `rm ~/.agentanycast/daemon.sock`

## "NAT traversal failed"

Direct hole-punching did not succeed.

- This is common with symmetric NATs or strict corporate firewalls.
- Ensure a relay is configured — the daemon will automatically fall back to relay routing.
- If using UDP, check that your firewall allows outbound UDP traffic.
- Verify the relay server is reachable: `agentanycast status`
